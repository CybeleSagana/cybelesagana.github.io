		<h2>Size</h2>
		<p>Pacific rhododendrons can grow in many different sizes depending on where they are planted. On the
			smaller side, they might only reach about 3 to 5 feet tall. In the right conditions though, they can
			grow like a small tree, reaching up to 20 to 25 feet. They usually grow taller in shady places and stay
			shorter and bushier in sunnier spots.</p>
	</section>
	<section class="card">
		<h2>Where It Grows</h2>
		<p>This plant is native to the Pacific Northwest. You can find it west of the Cascade Mountains, from
			southern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon down into northern California. It grows in
			forests, along roadsides, and even up in the mountains at elevations around 6,000 feet.</p>

	<section class="card">
		<h2>Best Climate and Growing Conditions</h2>
		<p>Pacific rhododendrons like cool, damp areas with acidic, well-draining soil. In the wild, they are often
			found under big trees such as Douglas fir, Western red cedar, Western hemlock, and Sitka spruce. They
			can survive in drier conditions, but they thrive when the soil holds some moisture. They also grow well
			in disturbed areas like roadsides, where they even help prevent erosion.</p>

		<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

		<h3>Poisonous but interesting</h3>
		<p>Did you know rhododendrons are beautiful but a little dangerous? Every part of the plant has a natural
			toxin called grayanotoxin. If someone or some animal eats it, it can cause nausea, weakness, and even
			heart issues. Even bees that visit rhododendrons can make “mad honey,” which has been known to make
			people sick. Luckily, most of us just admire these flowers from a safe distance—and that’s exactly how
			they’re meant to be enjoyed.</p>

		<h3>Blooming season</h3>
		<p>These plants really know how to put on a show. They bloom in the spring and early summer, usually from
			April through July. The ones growing lower down in valleys and near the coast bloom first, while the
			mountain rhodies hold out until later. By late summer, August through September, their seed pods are
			ready to pop.</p>

		<h3>A state symbol with a story</h3>
		<p>The Pacific rhododendron wasn’t chosen as Washington’s state flower by accident. Back in 1892, local
			women were asked to pick a flower to represent Washington at the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago. They
			voted for this vibrant, tough little plant that thrives in the Northwest. People loved the choice so
			much that decades later, in 1959, it was officially made the state flower. Today, hikers and gardeners
			still think of it as one of the most iconic plants in Washington.</p>
