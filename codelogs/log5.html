        <h2>What are the differences between presenting an image using an HTML tag (like < img>) and presenting it as
                the background of an HTML element (using the CSS property background-image)? </h2>
        <p>
            The main difference between using an HTML img tag and a CSS background image is how and why they are used.
            The img tag is used when you want to show an image that is part of your website’s main content. For example,
            you might use it for a photo, a diagram, or something important that visitors need to see or understand.
            This kind of image can include alternative text, also called alt text, which describes the picture for
            people who cannot see it or who use screen readers. It also helps search engines understand what the image
            is about. A background image in CSS is used only to decorate a webpage, such as adding a pattern, texture,
            or design in the background. It does not have any meaning and cannot be read by screen readers. Unlike the
            img tag, a background image does not affect how text or other content is arranged on the page. It simply
            appears behind everything to make the page look more attractive. In short, use an img tag when the image is
            important to your content, and use a background image when it is only for decoration.
        </p>

        <h2>Besides background-image, what other CSS properties affect the display of background images? Describe at
            least two more CSS properties.</h2>
        <p>Besides background-image, there are several other CSS properties that affect how a background image is
            displayed. One of them is background-size, which controls how large or small the background image appears.
            For example, setting background-size to cover makes the image fill the entire element, while contain makes
            sure the whole image is visible without stretching. Another important property is background-position, which
            controls where the image is placed inside the element. You can move the image to the top, bottom, center, or
            use exact pixel or percentage values to place it precisely. There is also background-repeat, which decides
            if the image should repeat across the page, repeat only in one direction, or not repeat at all. These
            properties work together with background-image to control how the image looks, fits, and behaves within a
            webpage’s layout.

        <h2>In one sentence, how would you define the differences between dimensions and resolution in a bitmap image?
        </h2>
        <p>Dimensions describe how big an image looks, while resolution describes how sharp it looks.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What are the similarities and differences between the image file formats GIF, PNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, and SVG,
            and why are some better than others for specific uses?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The image file formats GIF, PNG, JPG (or JPEG), WebP, and SVG each serve different purposes based on how
            they handle image quality, size, and features. GIFs are best for simple animations and graphics with limited
            colors, such as short looping memes or moving icons. PNGs are great for high-quality images, logos, and
            graphics that need transparent backgrounds, like a company logo or a button design. JPGs are commonly used
            for photos, such as portraits or landscape pictures, since they can compress large images into smaller file
            sizes, though this can reduce quality over time. WebP is a newer format that combines the best of JPG and
            PNG, offering high quality, small file sizes, and even transparency or animation support which is perfect for web
            banners or social media images. SVGs are vector images that can scale infinitely without losing quality,
            which makes them perfect for logos, icons, and illustrations that need to stay sharp at any size, like a
            brand logo on both a phone and a desktop screen. Overall, WebP and JPG are best for photos, PNG and SVG are
            ideal for logos or graphics, and GIFs are mainly used for animations.
