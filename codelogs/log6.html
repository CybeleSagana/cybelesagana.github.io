        <h2>1. What did you look up?</h2>
        <p>I looked up the HTML < img> tag, which is used to display images on web pages. I focused on attributes like
                src, alt, width, height, and loading, as well as general tips for using images effectively.</p>

        <h2>2. What sites did you consult? Include links to the specific pages on those 4 resources.</h2>
        <p>Links:</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">W3Schools HTML img Tag</a></li>
        <li><a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images">MDN
                Web Docs HTML Images</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/09/revealing-images-css-mask-animations/">Smashing Magazine
                Image Article</a></li>

        <h2>3. What are the differences in the information presented on each site?</h2>
        <p>The four websites I looked at each present information about the < img> tag in different ways, and each has
                its own strengths. W3Schools is very organized and beginner-friendly, making it easy to follow for
                someone
                just learning HTML. It clearly explains all the main attributes, like src, alt, width, and height, and
                it
                gives simple examples that show exactly how to use them. MDN Web Docs provides a much more detailed and
                thorough explanation, including more advanced attributes like loading and srcset, as well as notes on
                browser compatibility and accessibility. This makes it an excellent resource for understanding the full
                capabilities of the < img> tag. Smashing Magazine focuses on one topic at a time and provides concise
                    articles that are good for quick insights, but it does not go as deep or cover as many variations
                    and
                    attributes as the other sites. Finally, the HTML Cheat Sheet is very different from the rest because
                    it only
                    lists the coding elements with not much explanations or examples. This makes it ideal for quickly
                    finding a tag or
                    attribute when you already know what you are looking for, but it is not very helpful for someone
                    trying to
                    learn the details of how the < img> tag works.</p>

        <h2>4. What features do you think a code reference page should offer? </h2>
        <p>A good code reference page should provide a balance between detailed information and easy accessibility. It
            should clearly display the syntax for each element or property and explain all relevant attributes or
            options. Including practical examples is essential because they show how the code actually works, which is
            especially helpful for beginners or visual learners. The page should also include guidance on best practices
            and accessibility, such as using alt text for images to make web content usable for everyone. Navigation and
            search functions are important so users can quickly find what they need without having to scroll through
            long pages of text. Ideally, a reference page should serve both users who want a quick reminder of a tag or
            property and those who want to fully understand its use in real coding projects.</p>

        <h2>5. Do any of your 4 resources stand out as particularly good or bad?</h2>
        <p>In my opinion, W3Schools is the best resource because it is very clear, well-organized, and easy to follow.
            The explanations are straightforward, and the examples make it simple to understand how to use the < img>
                tag, which has helped me a lot throughout this course. MDN Web Docs is also excellent, offering
                thorough,
                detailed information that includes advanced attributes, browser compatibility, and accessibility tips,
                so it
                is perfect for someone who wants to fully understand the tag. On the other hand, Smashing Magazine is
                the
                least helpful of the four. While it can provide quick insights, it focuses on only one topic at a time
                and
                doesn’t cover all the attributes or use cases, so it lacks the depth and variety I find most useful. The
                HTML Cheat Sheet is okay, and it is great for quickly finding a tag or attribute, but because it does
                not
                give explanations or examples, it is not as helpful for learning. Overall, W3Schools is my top choice
                for
                clarity and usability, while Smashing Magazine is my least helpful resource.</p>
