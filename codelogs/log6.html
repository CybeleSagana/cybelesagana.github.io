        <h2>What did you look up?</h2>
        <p>I looked up the HTML < img> tag, which is used to display images on web pages. I focused on attributes like
                src, alt, width, height, and loading, as well as general tips for using images effectively.</p>

        <h2>What sites did you consult? Include links to the specific pages on those 4 resources.</h2>
        <p>Links:</p>
        <li>https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_img.asp</li>
        <li>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_images</li>
        <li>https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/09/revealing-images-css-mask-animations/</li>
        <li>https://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/</li>

        <h2>What are the differences in the information presented on each site?</h2>
        <p>The four websites I looked at each present information about the < img > tag in different ways, and each has
            its own strengths. W3Schools is very organized and beginner-friendly, making it easy to follow for someone
            just learning HTML. It clearly explains all the main attributes, like src, alt, width, and height, and it
            gives simple examples that show exactly how to use them. MDN Web Docs provides a much more detailed and
            thorough explanation, including more advanced attributes like loading and srcset, as well as notes on
            browser compatibility and accessibility. This makes it an excellent resource for understanding the full
            capabilities of the < img > tag. Smashing Magazine focuses on one topic at a time and provides concise
            articles that are good for quick insights, but it does not go as deep or cover as many variations and
            attributes as the other sites. Finally, the HTML Cheat Sheet is very different from the rest because it only
            lists the coding elements with not much explanations or examples. This makes it ideal for quickly finding a tag or
            attribute when you already know what you are looking for, but it is not very helpful for someone trying to
            learn the details of how the < img > tag works.</p>
