    <h1>Log 4: CSS Color</h1>

        <h2>What do these CSS properties do?</h2>
        <p>CSS uses color to make web pages more visually appealing, readable, and organized. By using color, designers
            can highlight important information, create contrast between elements, and make content easier for users to
            follow. There are several CSS properties that control how color is applied. The color property changes the
            color of the text inside an element, allowing you to make words stand out or match the overall design of the
            page. The background-color property sets the color behind an element’s content, which can help separate
            sections, improve readability, or create a mood for the page. The border-color property changes the color of
            an element’s border, adding definition and helping elements stand out from the background. Together, these
            properties give designers precise control over how color appears on a webpage and improve both the style and
            usability of the site.</p>

        <h2>How does CSS accept color as a value? Provide examples of colors in these styles:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Named</li>
                <p>These are simple color names that CSS already recognizes, such as red, blue, green, or coral.
                    Example: color: red;</p>
                <li>Hexadecimal</li>
                <p>These use a “#” followed by numbers and letters that represent the red, green, and blue values of a
                    color.
                    Example: background-color: #00ff00; (green)</p>
                <li>RGB</li>
                <p>This format mixes red, green, and blue values, each between 0 and 255.
                    Example: border-color: rgb(255, 0, 0); (red)</p>
                <li>HSL</li>
                <p>This stands for hue, saturation, and lightness, which define color based on its position on the color
                    wheel.
                    Example: color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%); (green)</p>
            </ul>
