    <h1>Log 4: CSS Color</h1>

        <h2>What do these CSS properties do?</h2>
        <p>CSS uses color to make web pages more visually appealing, readable, and organized. By using color, designers
            can highlight important information, create contrast between elements, and make content easier for users to
            follow. There are several CSS properties that control how color is applied. The color property changes the
            color of the text inside an element, allowing you to make words stand out or match the overall design of the
            page. The background-color property sets the color behind an element’s content, which can help separate
            sections, improve readability, or create a mood for the page. The border-color property changes the color of
            an element’s border, adding definition and helping elements stand out from the background. Together, these
            properties give designers precise control over how color appears on a webpage and improve both the style and
            usability of the site.</p>

        <h2>How does CSS accept color as a value? Provide examples of colors in these styles:</h2>
        <ul>
            <strong>
                <li>Named</li>
            </strong>
            <p>These are simple, predefined names that CSS already recognizes. Examples include red, blue, green, coral,
                and many others. Named colors are easy to remember and use, making them helpful for basic designs or
                when you want to quickly apply a common color without needing to know its exact numeric values. For
                example, writing color: red; will change the text to red instantly.</p>
            <strong>
                <li>Hexadecimal</li>
            </strong>
            <p>Hex colors use a # followed by six numbers or letters, which represent the red, green, and blue
                components of the color. Each pair of characters can range from 00 to FF and determines how much of that
                color is present. Hex codes give designers more precise control over colors and allow for a wider range
                of shades than named colors. Example: background-color: #ff0000; produces a bright red background.</p>
            <strong>
                <li>RGB</li>
            </strong>
            <p>RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, the three primary colors of light. You can set each color component
                with a number from 0 to 255, and CSS will mix them to create the final color. RGB allows for precise
                customization and is often easier to adjust than hex codes when experimenting with color. Example:
                border-color: rgb(255, 0, 0); will create a bright red border.</p>
            <strong>
                <li>HSL</li>
            </strong>
            <p>HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Hue represents the color on a 360-degree color wheel (0 or
                360 is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue). Saturation determines how intense the color is, from 0% (gray)
                to 100% (full color), and Lightness controls how dark or light the color appears. HSL is very intuitive
                because it lets designers think about colors in terms of shades and intensity. Example: color: hsl(360,
                50%, 50%); produces a /dark red text color.</p>
        </ul>
