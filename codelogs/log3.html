<h1>Log 3: CSS Media Queries</h1>

        <h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
        <p>A CSS media query is like giving your website the ability to notice what kind of device it is being viewed on
            and then adjust its look to fit. For example, if someone opens a page on a large computer screen, the site
            can show one layout, but if they open it on a phone, the site can rearrange itself so everything is easier
            to read and use. Media queries check things like screen size, orientation, or even whether someone prefers
            dark mode, and then apply special styles based on those conditions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is useful because it makes a website responsive, which means the layout adapts to different screens
            instead of staying stuck in one rigid design. That way the same site feels comfortable and easy to use
            whether it is on a phone, tablet, or desktop. Media queries give developers the power to create sites that
            look good and work well for everyone, no matter how they choose to view them.</p>

        <h2>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do
            they do? Pick any 4 to explain.</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Width</h3>
                <p>This is probably the most common media feature and the one people use the most when making responsive
                    designs. Width checks how wide the screen or browser window is. You can set it so that if the screen
                    is less than a certain number of pixels (like 600px), your site looks one way, and if it is wider,
                    it looks another way. This is how websites can switch from a single-column layout on a phone to a
                    multi-column layout on a laptop. Width is powerful because it helps your site adapt to the wide
                    range of devices people use every day.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Orientation</h3>
                <p>Orientation is just about the direction of the screen. Portrait means the screen is taller than it is
                    wide, like when you hold your phone straight up and down. Landscape means the screen is wider than
                    it is tall, like when you turn your phone sideways or when you are on a laptop. The reason this
                    matters is because a design that looks nice in portrait might look squished or awkward in landscape,
                    and vice versa. With media queries, you can tell your site to show things differently depending on
                    the orientation. For example, you could show a tall picture in portrait and switch to a wide picture
                    in landscape so it always looks good.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Pointer</h3>
                <p>The pointer feature checks what kind of input device the user has. A mouse or trackpad is called
                    “fine” because it can move very precisely, which makes it easy to click small buttons. A
                    touchscreen, on the other hand, is called “coarse” because fingers need bigger tap areas to work
                    comfortably. There is also “none,” which means no pointer at all, like someone using a keyboard or
                    voice commands. This feature is useful because it lets you design for different ways people interact
                    with your site. For example, you could create larger clickable areas for touchscreen users so it
                    feels easier to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Resolution</h3>
                <p>Resolution is all about how sharp and detailed the screen is. Some devices, especially modern
                    smartphones, have really high-resolution screens that can show images in a lot of detail. Other
                    devices might not be as sharp. With this feature, you can serve higher-quality images or tweak font
                    sizes so that your site looks clear and readable on every device. This helps make sure that your
                    design does not look blurry or stretched on high-resolution screens while still performing well on
                    older or less powerful devices.</p>
