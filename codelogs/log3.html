        <h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>
        <p>A CSS media query is like giving your website the ability to notice what kind of device it is being viewed on
            and then adjust its look to fit. For example, if someone opens a page on a large computer screen, the site
            can show one layout, but if they open it on a phone, the site can rearrange itself so everything is easier
            to read and use. Media queries check things like screen size, orientation, or even whether someone prefers
            dark mode, and then apply special styles based on those conditions.</p>
<hr>
        <p>This is useful because it makes a website responsive, which means the layout adapts to different screens
            instead of staying stuck in one rigid design. That way the same site feels comfortable and easy to use
            whether it is on a phone, tablet, or desktop. Media queries give developers the power to create sites that
            look good and work well for everyone, no matter how they choose to view them.</p>
