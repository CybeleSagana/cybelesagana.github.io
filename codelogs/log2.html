<h1>Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units?</h2>

<body>
	<p>In CSS, there are two main ways to measure size which are called absolute units and relative units. Absolute
		units are fixed, meaning they stay the same size no matter what. For example, if you make a box 100px wide, it
		will always try to stay 100px wide whether you are on a phone, laptop, or TV. Units like px for pixels, cm for
		centimeters, or in for inches are all absolute because they do not change based on the screen or text. Relative
		units work differently because their size depends on something else, such as the font size of the text or the
		size of the screen. For example, 2em means two times the current text size, so if the text is 16px, then 2em
		would equal 32px. Another example is 50vw which means the element will take up half the width of the screen no
		matter how big or small the screen is. Absolute units are useful when you need something to stay an exact size,
		while relative units are helpful for making websites flexible and easier to read on different devices.</p>

<h2>Explain 3 units in CSS.</h2>

<body>
	<p>One of the most common CSS units is px, which means pixels.
		A pixel is the tiny dot of light that makes up everything you see on a computer or phone screen.
		If you could zoom in very closely on your screen, you would see many little squares of light sitting next to
		each other, and those are pixels. When we use px in CSS, we are telling the computer exactly how many of those
		dots something should take up. For example, if you make a box 200px wide, the computer will count out 200 dots
		of
		light across the screen for that box. Pixels are called an absolute unit, which means they stay the same size in
		CSS even though the physical dots may look slightly different on phones, laptops, or televisions. This makes
		pixels
		very exact, but sometimes less flexible when you want your design to adapt to different screen sizes.
		CSS also uses pt, which stands for points. A point is a unit that comes from print design, and there are seventy
		two
		points in an inch. For example, text set to 12pt would be twelve out of seventy two parts of an inch in height.
		Points are also considered an absolute unit, and while they are most useful for printed documents, you may still
		see them used for text on the web.</p>

	<p>Another useful set of CSS units are em and rem. These are called relative units, which means their size
		depends on something else rather than being fixed.
		The em unit is based on the font size of the current text. For example, if a paragraph of text is set to 16px,
		then 2em would equal 32px. If the font size changes, the em value changes as well. This is useful when you want
		something to grow or shrink depending on the text size of its parent element. The rem unit, which stands for
		root em, works in a similar way but always uses the root font size of the page. Usually the root font size is
		16px, so 1rem is always 16px, 2rem is always 32px, and so on. This makes rem a good choice when you want
		consistent sizing across the entire page, while em is better when you want sizes to adjust along with their
		parent text.</p>


	<p>CSS also includes the units vw and vh, which stand for viewport width and viewport height. The viewport is simply
		the
		visible area of the screen, like the window you are looking at when you open a website. One vw equals one
		percent of
		the screen’s width, and one vh equals one percent of the screen’s height. For example, if you set a box to
		100vw, it will
		stretch across the entire width of the screen, no matter what device is being used. If you set something to
		50vh, it will
		take up half of the screen’s height. These units are very helpful for creating layouts that adjust automatically
		when the
		screen changes size. For example, a banner can always fill the screen whether it is viewed on a small phone or
		on a
		large desktop monitor.</p>

	In summary, px is like measuring with a ruler for an exact size, em and rem are like measuring based on the size of
	the text, and vw and vh are like measuring based on the size of the screen itself. By understanding how these units
	work, a web designer can choose whether to make elements stay fixed, grow with the text, or change with the screen.
